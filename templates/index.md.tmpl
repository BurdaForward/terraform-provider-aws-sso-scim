# AWS SSO SCIM Provider

Terraform provider to modify contents of [AWS SSO](https://aws.amazon.com/single-sign-on/) via the [SCIM implementation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/developerguide/what-is-scim.html).

This provider will allow you to interact with and modify user and group data that is stored in your AWS SSO instance. This can be helpful to pre-provision users and group memberships to your SSO instance, or modify user attributes. Do note that this will not allow you to create actual users in your attached identity provider.
